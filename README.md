# Distributed Computing


## Overview

Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.

## Features

- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure the system continues to operate even in the event of failures.
- **Resource Sharing:** Efficiently share resources among multiple users and applications.

## Installation

To get started with your distributed computing project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhirajsharma2060/Distributed_computing.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Distributed_computing
    ```

## Examples

Below are some examples of how to use the distributed computing system:

- **Example 1:**
    ```bash
    python submit_task.py --task example1
    ```

- **Example 2:**
    ```bash
    python submit_task.py --task example2
    ```
